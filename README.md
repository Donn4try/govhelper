Hello! I want to present my project in the form of an govhelper for players who play as the government, which in this context is the GTA SA-MP admin. 

### <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/216120974-24a76b31-7f39-41f1-a38f-b3c1377cc612.png" alt="Teacup Without Handle" width="20" /> &nbsp; Among them are some of the features below:

- floating button that works within a certain player radius to open the player interaction menu
- basic visual of government autorp help players (easier than typing manually)
- main menu that can be accessed with the command (/ghelp) which displays helper inteface in-game
- reminder message feature for goverment automatically every few minutes
- autorp gun for android
- toggle for auto capitalization of first and last letters always ends with a period
- The feature registers commands which will later be changed into visual buttons (which can speed up and make things easier for desktop and mobile devices).
- I don't know if this feature is useful or not, but I added a different feature for custom commands for high government and some features that only they can access.
- visual notes feature that can be edited in-game
- The UI color can be changed as you wish
- UI size that can be changed to any size
- features can reset settings, force shutdown, and forcibly remove adminmenu directly from ingame
