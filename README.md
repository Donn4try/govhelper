Hello! I want to present my project in the form of an govhelper for players who play as the government, which in this context is the GTA SA-MP admin.

- floating button that works within a certain player radius to open the player menu (admin only)
- basic visual of admin commands to help players (easier than typing manually)
- main menu that can be accessed with the command (/ahmenu) which displays admin data in-game
- reminder message feature for admin automatically every few minutes
- autorp for android admins who like robbary
- toggle for auto capitalization of first and last letters always ends with a period
- The feature registers commands which will later be changed into visual buttons (which can speed up and make things easier for admins with desktop and mobile devices).
- I don't know if this feature is useful or not, but I added a different feature for custom commands for high rank admins and some features that only they can access.
- visual notes feature that can be edited in-game
- The UI color can be changed as you wish
- UI size that can be changed to any size
- features can reset settings, force shutdown, and forcibly remove adminmenu directly from ingame
- 
**For those of you who are familiar with the adminmenu UI design, MTG MOD and I have been working together to create this project since last year. Here is a preview:**
